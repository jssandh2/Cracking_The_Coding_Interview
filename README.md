# Cracking_The_Coding_Interview
These are my versions of solutions to some problems that I have picked up from "Cracking The Coding Interview", Gayle Laakmann McDowell, 2nd Edition, and some other problems that I have found at algorithmic programming websites online. All solutions are mine, and I am not copying or plagiarizing code from anywhere. The solutions are written in Python.
